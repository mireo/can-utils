C++ CAN utilities, including fully compliant CAN DBC C++ parser===============================================================[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/mireo/can-utils.svg)](https://github.com/mireo/can-utils/graphs/contributors)[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)](README.md)[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)](README.md)[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/mireo/can-utils.svg)](https://github.com/mireo/can-utils/issues)Introduction------------This repository contains several CAN (Controller Area Network) C++ utilities which could simplify collecting, decoding, transcoding and transferring CAN messages to cloud.Most of the code in the repository is designed to run on an edge device (for example, an embedded telemetry device). However, utilities like CAN DBC parser or CAN frame packet buffer can also be used on server side, thus providing some of the essential tools in [IOT telemetry](https://iotatlas.net/en/patterns/telemetry/) ecosystems.Features--------* [DBC parser](dbc/README.md)    * A complete, customizable and efficient DBC parser written in C++ with full DBC syntax support for all keywords.* [Vehicle-To-Cloud Transcoder](v2c/README.md)    * Edge-computing telemetric component that groups, filters, and aggregates CAN signals. Can drastically reduce the amount of data sent from the device over the network.Uses the DBC parser to read and define the CAN network.How to Build------------#### 1. Fetch Boost* Download [Boost](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) and move it to your include pathThe project requires only headers from Boost, so no libraries need to be built.#### 2. BuildYou can compile the example as follows:```sh$ g++ -std=c++20 example/example.cpp dbc/dbc_parser.cpp v2c/v2c_transcoder.cpp -I . -o can_example````can-utils` has been tested with Clang, GCC and MSVC on Windows and Linux. It requires C++20.Usage-----### Example- [Full source here](example/example.cpp)Build, then run without any command line arguments:```sh$ ./can_example```The example program parses [example.dbc](example/example.dbc), generates millions of random frames, aggregates them with `v2c_transcoder`, and prints the decoded raw signals to the console.Example output:```pyNew frame_packet (from 2121812 frames): can_frame at t: 1683709842.116000s, can_id: 4  SOCavg: 574 can_frame at t: 1683709842.116000s, can_id: 6  RawBattCurrent: 10914  SmoothBattCurrent: 10921  BattVoltage: 32760 can_frame at t: 1683709842.516000s, can_id: 2  GPSAccuracy: 118  GPSLongitude: -106019721  GPSLatitude: 26758102 can_frame at t: 1683709842.516000s, can_id: 3  GPSAltitude: -8084 can_frame at t: 1683709842.516000s, can_id: 5  GPSSpeed: 2160 can_frame at t: 1683709842.516000s, can_id: 7  PowerState: 2 can_frame at t: 1683709842.616000s, can_id: 4  SOCavg: 163 can_frame at t: 1683709842.616000s, can_id: 6  RawBattCurrent: -27877  SmoothBattCurrent: -27827  BattVoltage: 32731  ...```The signal values are raw decoded bytes, not scaled by the signal's factor or offset.___### DBC Parser- [Full documentation here.](dbc/README.md)The parser can be used as follows:```cppcustom_dbc dbc_impl; // custom class that implements your logic and data structuresbool success = can::parse_dbc(dbc_content, std::ref(dbc_impl)); // parses the DBC// dbc_impl is now populated by the parser and can be used```The behavior of the parser is customized by user-defined callbacks invoked when parsing a DBC keyword.Defining the following callback would print all `BO_` objects (messages) in the DBC, and call `add_message()` on `dbc_impl`:``` cppinline void tag_invoke(	def_bo_cpo, dbc_impl& this_,	uint32_t msg_id, std::string msg_name, size_t msg_size, size_t transmitter_ord) {	std::cout << "New message '" << msg_name << "' with ID = " << msg_id << std::endl;	this_.add_message(msg_id, msg_name, msg_size);}```The full list of callback function signatures, with examples, can be found [here](dbc/README.md).___### V2C Transcoder- [Full documentation here](v2c/README.md)V2C is modeled as a node in the CAN network. It reads CAN frames as input, aggregates their values, and encodes them back into CAN `frame_packets`.To use it, initialize `v2c_transcoder` and then call its `transcode(t, frame)` method with frames read from the CAN socket.`transcode()` periodically returns a `frame_packet` containing the aggregated `can_frames`, ready to be sent over the network.```cppcan::v2c_transcoder transcoder;can::parse_dbc(read_file("example/example.dbc"), std::ref(transcoder));while (true) {	// read a frame from the CAN socket	can_frame frame = read_frame();	auto t = std::chrono::system_clock::now();	auto fp = transcoder.transcode(t, frame);	if (fp) {		// send the frame_packet over the network		send_frame_packet(fp);	}}```The transcoder's message groups, aggregation types and sampling/sending windows are customized through the DBC directly:```pyEV_ V2CTxTime: 0 [0|60000] "ms" 2000 1 DUMMY_NODE_VECTOR1 V2C;EV_ GPSGroupTxFreq: 0 [0|60000] "ms" 600 11 DUMMY_NODE_VECTOR1 V2C;EV_ EnergyGroupTxFreq: 0 [0|60000] "ms" 500 13 DUMMY_NODE_VECTOR1 V2C;BA_ "AggType" SG_  7 PowerState "LAST";BA_ "AggType" SG_  4 SOCavg "LAST";BA_ "AggType" SG_  6 RawBattCurrent "AVG";BA_ "AggType" SG_  6 SmoothBattCurrent "AVG";```A more in-depth explanation can be found [here](v2c/README.md).Contributing------------When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.You may merge a Pull Request once you have the sign-off from other developers, or you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.License-------Copyright (c) 2001-2023 Mireo, EURedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:1.
